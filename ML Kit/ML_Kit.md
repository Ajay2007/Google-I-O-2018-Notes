## ML Kit for building machine learnign app for android.


TensorFlow Lite
A  ligjtweight machine learning library and tools for mobile and embedded devices.

ML Kit  is a google machine learning sdk for mobile devices

These are Neural Networks APIs

1. ML kit is both for android as well as ios app.
2. Base APIs and custom model support
3. On-device and Google Cloud AI inference APIs
4. Deeply integrated with firebase  (it works other features of firebase)

Base APis 
Simple APIs that solve practical use cases
  1. Text recognition
  2. Image Labeling
  3. Barcode Scanning
  4. Face detection
  5. Landmark recognition
  6. High density face contour feature and smart reply API () Same technology use in wear os
  7. We can upload ML model to the firebase console 
  
Custom Modle Support
  Simplify use of custom ML model
  Dyanmic model downloads
  A/B testing via Firebase Remote Config
  Model conversion and compression (IT will help us to convert full tensorflow model into lightweight tensorflow model)
